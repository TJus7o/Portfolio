    <p>
    I have been working since I was 18 years old in a many fields that made me realize
    that i need something more stimulating.
    </p> 
    <p>
    It lead me to a Web and Mobile Development course at CESAE, that took place since
    mid February to the end of October, being the last two months as an intern in Merkle Dach, were i worked in a Frontend
    project for the company.
    </p>
    <p>
    After that I have been searching for my first oportunity as a Frontend Developer, and I am hoping that this Portfolio helps me get there.
